# QT_dxfrw
Qt project example of the dxfrw c++ library

This is the same dxfrw lib used in librecad, freecad etc.

This example show's how to use the dxfrw library and display the dxf content with the opencascade widget.

Depends : Qt + opencascade library

Currently supporting :
- cw contours
- lead-in + lead-out

Next to code :
- contour depth sequence, that will result in producing ccw contours by swapping the cw contour.
